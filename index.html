                JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted compiled programming language which is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. Javascript is both imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements.

                It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape. It was originally going to be named LiveScript but was renamed. Unlike most programming languages, the JavaScript language has no concept of input or output. It is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment, and it is up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world. The most common host environment is the browser.

                According to a recent survey conducted by Stack Overflow, JavaScript is the most popular language on earth. 
                With advances in browser technology and JavaScript having moved into the server with Node.js and other frameworks, JavaScript is capable of so much more. 
                <ul>
                    Here are a few things that we can do with JavaScript:
                    <li>
                        JavaScript was created in the first place for DOM manipulation. Earlier websites were mostly static, after JS was created dynamic Web sites were made.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Functions in JS are objects. They may have properties and methods just like another object. They can be passed as arguments in other functions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Can handle date and time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Performs Form Validation although the forms are created using HTML.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        No compiler is needed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                <li>
                    Web Development: Adding interactivity and behavior to static sites JavaScript was invented to do this in 1995. By using AngularJS that can be achieved so easily.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Web Applications: With technology, browsers have improved to the extent that a language was required to create robust web applications. When we explore a map in Google Maps then we only need to click and drag the mouse. All detailed view is just a click away, and this is possible only because of JavaScript. It uses Application Programming Interfaces(APIs) that provide extra power to the code. The Electron and React is helpful in this department.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Server Applications: With the help of Node.js, JavaScript made its way from client to server and node.js is the most powerful on the server-side.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Games: Not only in websites, but JavaScript also helps in creating games for leisure. The combination of JavaScript and HTML 5 makes JavaScript popular in game development as well. It provides the EaseJS library which provides solutions for working with rich graphics.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Smartwatches: JavaScript is being used in all possible devices and applications. It provides a library PebbleJS which is used in smartwatch applications. This framework works for applications that require the internet for its functioning.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Art: Artists and designers can create whatever they want using JavaScript to draw on HTML 5 canvas, and make the sound more effective also can be used p5.js library.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Machine Learning: This JavaScript ml5.js library can be used in web development by using machine learning.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mobile Applications: JavaScript can also be used to build an application for non-web contexts. The features and uses of JavaScript make it a powerful tool for creating mobile applications. This is a Framework for building web and mobile apps using JavaScript. Using React Native, we can build mobile applications for different operating systems. We do not require to write code for different systems. Write once use it anywhere!

        <section  class="main-section" id="Limitations_of_JavaScript">
            <header>Limitations of JavaScript</header>
            <ul>
                Security risks: JavaScript can be used to fetch data using AJAX or by manipulating tags that load data such as img object script. These attacks are called cross site script attacks. They inject JS that is not the part of the site into the visitor`s browser thus fetching the details. 
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Performance: JavaScript does not provide the same level of performance as offered by many traditional languages as a complex program written in JavaScript would be comparatively slow. But as JavaScript is used to perform simple tasks in a browser, so performance is not considered a big restriction in its use.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Complexity: To master a scripting language, programmers must have a thorough knowledge of all the programming concepts, core language objects, client and server-side objects otherwise it would be difficult for them to write advanced scripts using JavaScript.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Weak error handling and type checking facilities: It is weakly typed language as there is no need to specify the data type of the variable. So wrong type checking is not performed by compile.

            <header>Why JavaScript is known as a lightweight programming language?</header>
            <p>
                JavaScript is considered as lightweight due to the fact that it has low CPU usage, is easy to implement and has a minimalist syntax. Minimalist syntax as in, it has no data types. Everything is treated here as an object. It is very easy to learn because of its syntax similar to C++ and Java.
            </p>
            <p>
                A lightweight language does not consume much of your CPU`s resources. It doesn`t put excess strain on your CPU or RAM. JavaScript runs in the browser even though it has complex paradigms and logic which means it uses fewer resources than other languages. For example, NodeJs, a variation of JavaScript not only performs faster computations but also uses less resources than its counterparts such as Dart or Java.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, when compared with other programming languages, it has less in-built libraries or frameworks, contributing as another reason for it to be lightweight. However, this brings it a drawback that we need to incorporate external libraries and frameworks.

            <header>Is JavaScript compiled or interpreted or both?</header>
            <p>
                JavaScript is both compiled and interpreted. In the earlier versions of JavaScript, it used only the interpreter that executed code line by line and shows the result immediately. But with time the performance became an issue as interpretation is quite slow. Therefore, in the newer versions of JS, probably after the V8, JIT compiler was also incorporated to optimize the execution and display the result more quickly. This JIT compiler generates a bytecode that is relatively easier to code. This bytecode is a set of highly optimized instructions. 
                The V8 engine initially uses an interpreter, to interpret the code. On further executions, the V8 engine finds patterns such as frequently executed functions, frequently used variables, and compiles them to improve performance.

            <p>
                The programming instructions written in a program in a programming language are known as statements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Order of execution of Statements is the same as they are written.
                <ol>
                    <li>Semicolons:
                        Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.
                        Semicolon marks the end of a statement in javascript.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Code Blocks:
                        JavaScript statements can be grouped together inside curly brackets. Such groups are known as code blocks. The purpose of grouping is to define statements to be executed together.

                        Keywords:
                        Keywords are reserved words and cannot be used as variable name.
                        A Javascript keyword tells about what kind of operation it will perform.
                        Some commonly used keywords are:

                        break: This is used to terminate a loop or switch.
                        continue: This is used to skip a particular iteration in a loop and move to next iteration.
                        do…. while: In this the statements written within do block are executed till the condition in while is true.
                        for: It helps in executing a block of statements till the condition is true.
                        function: This keyword is used to declare a function.
                        return: This keyword is used to exit a function.
                        switch: This helps in executing a block of codes depending on different cases.
                        var: This keyword is used to declare a variable with a global scope.
                        let: This keyword is used to declare a variable with block scope. Variables declared using let need not be initialized.
                        const: This keyword is used to declare a variable with block scope. Variables declared using const must be initialized at the place of declaration

            <p>
                JavaScript is a lightweight and dynamic computer programming language. It is used to create client-side dynamic pages. It is an open-source and cross-platform language.  
                <code>document.write("Basic Print method in JavaScript");</code>  
                JavaScript syntax refers to the set of rules that determines how JavaScript programs are constructed:
            </p>
            <p><code>
                    // Variable declaration
                    var c, d, e;
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>
                    // Assign value to the variable
                    c = 5; 
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>
                    // Computer value of variables
                    d = c;
                    e = c/d;
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript Variables: A JavaScript variable is the simple name of storage location where data to be stored. There are two types of variables in JavaScript which are listed below: 
                Local variables: Declare a variable inside of block or function.
                Global variables: Declare a variable outside function or with a window object.
